* System Requirements

   1. Perl, version 5.6 or above.  I have not successfully run this
on earlier versions.  Please tell me if you can.  You can run
"perl -v" to see your current Perl version.  Perl is distributed
with most Unix now.  If not, or if you have an older version of Perl,
you can download and install/upgrade it from Perl website.

http://www.perl.com/

      If you are using MS-Windows, you can download and install
ActiveState ActivePerl.

      HTML::LinkExtor is contained in the HTML-Parser distribution.
      You can download and install HTML::LinkExtor from the CPAN archive
      http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Parser/ ,

      ActivePerl users can install it by running
      "ppm install HTML::LinkExtor".

    * LWP::RobotUA

          This is used to request web pages.
      LWP::RobotUA is contained in the libwww-perl distribution.
      You can download and install LWP::RobotUA from the CPAN archive
      http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl/ ,
      or install it with the CPAN shell by running "cpan LWP::RobotUA",
      or install it with the CPANPLUS shell by running
      "cpanp i LWP::RobotUA".
      Debian/Ubandu Linux users can install it by running

      ActivePerl users can install it by running
      "ppm install LWP::RobotUA".

      If you install chklinks with the CPAN or CPANPLUS shell, the above
  shall be automatically installed.

   3. Optional Perl modules:

    * Crypt::SSLeay

          This is needed for LWP::RobotUA to support HTTPS.
      You can download and install Crypt::SSLeay from the CPAN archive
      http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt-SSLeay/ ,
      or install it with the CPAN shell by running "cpan Crypt::SSLeay",

      "apt-get install libcrypt-ssleay-perl".
      Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS Linux users can install it by running
      "yum install perl-Crypt-SSLeay".
      FreeBSD users can install it by running
      "ports install p5-Crypt-SSLeay".
      ActiveState does not host the PPM build of Crypt::SSLeay for
      ActivePerl due to the Canadian Federal Government requirement.
      However, ActivePerl users can still install it from another
      repository, by running
      "ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/Crypt-SSLeay.ppd"


* Installation Instruction

** Install with ExtUtils::MakeMaker

    chklinks uses standard Perl installation with ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Follow these steps:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

    When running make install, make sure you have the priviledge to
write to the installation location.  This usually requires the root
priviledge.

    If you are using ActivePerl under MS-Windows, you should use
nmake instead of make. nmake can be obtained from the Microsoft FTP
site.

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the
PREFIX.  For example, to install into your home when you are not
root:

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more
installation options (by running perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker).


** Install with Module::Build

    You can install with Module::Build instead, if you prefer.
Follow these steps:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build
    % ./Build test
    % ./Build install

    When running ./Build install, make sure you have the priviledge to
write to the installation location.  This usually requires the root
priviledge.

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the
--prefix.  For example, to install into your home when you are not
root:

    % perl Build.PL --prefix=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of Module::Build for more
installation options (by running perldoc Module::Build).
