    chklinks is a non-threaded Perl link checker.  It helps finding
broken links on your website.

    chklinks differs from linkchecker in that chklinks is
non-threaded.  It does not raises many simultaneously connections for
its job.  It won't run out of the resources and crash your system in a
moment.  This is certainly more desirable for most webmasters and
users.

    chklinks follows robots.txt rules.  If you disallow robots from
your website and experience problems, you need to allow chklinks.
Add the following lines to your robots.txt file to allow chklinks:

      User-agent: chklinks
      Disallow:

    chklinks uses LWP::RobotUA and support the following schemes:
http, https, ftp, gopher, file.  You can also specify a local file.
(To use https, you need to install Crypt::SSLeay.)

    chklinks supports cookies.

    See INSTALL for instructions on how to install chklinks.

    If you encounter warnings like this:

      Parsing of undecoded UTF-8 will give garbage when decoding
      entities at /usr/share/perl5/LWP/Protocol.pm line 114.

    This is an issue of LWP::Protocol version <= 1.43 (in libwww-perl
version <= 5.805) when working with HTML::Parser version >= 3.40 and
Perl version >= 5.8.  This issue is solved in LWP::Protocol version
>= 1.46 (in libwww-perl version >= 5.806).  You can upgrade your
LWP::Protocol to the current version.  If you cannot upgrade it, see
CPAN RT Bug#20274 http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20274
for an LWP::Protocol patch on this.
