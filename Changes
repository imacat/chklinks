2008-11-18
	 1. INSTALL: Fixed the grammar on installation with the CPAN or
	    CPANPLUS shell, changed "install with the CPAN shell using"
	    and "install with the CPANPLUS shell using" to "install it

	    chklinks.zh-cn.html: Updated information on required and

2007-12-05	version 3.08
	Documentation fixes.
	 1. README.zh-*, chklinks.zh-*.html: Fixed the description
	    "是用 Perl 寫的單執行緒連結檢查程式" to "是單執行緒的 Perl 連結

	Test suite updates
	 1. t/01-basic.t: Added test 21 to check if we have exhausted all

	    that are not available and returning HTTP 503.

	    the file:// URI gracefully.  Currently tested on Linux and
	    MSWin32.  More tests required.
