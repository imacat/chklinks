chklinks change log

2008-11-18
	 1. INSTALL: Fixed the grammer on installation with the CPAN or
	    CPANPLUS shell, changed "install with the CPAN shell using"
	    and "install with the CPANPLUS shell using" to "install it
	    with the CPAN shell by running" and "install it with the
	    CPANPLUS shell by running".
	 2. chklinks.en.html: Updated information on required and optional
	    Perl modules, to describe different installation commands for
	    different operating systems.
	 3. INSTALL and chklinks.en.html: Changed "Fedora/Red Hat" to
	    "Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS".
	 4. chklinks.zh-tw.html and chklinks.zh-cn.html: Removed
	    Date::Parse from the required modules.  It is a mistake when
	    copying text from arclog.
	 5. INSTALL.zh-tw, INSTALL.zh-cn, chklinks.zh-tw.html and
	    chklinks.zh-cn.html: Updated information on required and
	    optional Perl modules, to describe different installation
	    commands for different operating systems.

2008-11-17
	 1. INSTALL: Updated information on required and optional Perl
	    modules, to describe different installation commands for
	    different operating systems.
	 2. INSTALL: Fixed the grammer on the notes that required modules
	    are automatically installed if install from the CPAN or
	    CPANPLUS shell.
	 2. chklinks.en.html: Fixed the grammer of the required modules,
	    changed "is part of the xxx package" to "is contained in the
	    xxx distribution".

2008-04-21
	 1. INSTALL and chklinks.en.html: Fixed typo: "instalation" to
	    "installation".

2007-12-11
	 1. chklinks: Fixed the new() method of the _private::URI class to
	    initialize the URI if not a start URI and is provided as text.
	 2. chklinks: Fixed the new() method of the _private::URI class to
	    check $refuri with "ref($refuri)" instead of "ref $refuri", to
	    correct the calculating precedence.
	 3. chklinks: Fixed the new() method of the _private::URI class to
	    received a third argument $redir the redirection URI, and set
	    the base URI to first $redir, then second $refuri, and finally
	    $self->new_cwd.  Removed $norefuri as it is not used anymore.
	 4. chklinks: Added the outfail() method to the _private::URI class
	    to handle the failure output.  Fixed the check() method to use
	    outfail() method.
	 5. chklinks: Fixed the new() method of the _private::URI class to
	    replace the local file system updir and curdir with "." and
	    "..", according to the URI format.
	 6. chklinks: Fixed the as_string() method of the _private::URI::file
	    class so that it return only the file system path on normal
	    systems.
	 7. chklinks: Fixed the as_string() method of the _private::URI::file
	    class to add the trailing empty part when path is a directory.
	 8. chklinks: Added the static is_abs() method to the _private::URI,
	    _private::URI::file and _private::URI::mailto classes to check
	    if a given URI is absolute.

2007-12-08
	 1. chklinks: Fixed indefinite articles in the comments, "an mailto
	    URI" as "a mailto URI", "an URL" as "a URL", "an URI" as "a URI".

2007-12-07
	 1. chklinks: Added the as_string() method to the _private::URI class
	    to return the as_string() method of the URI.  This is a shortcut.
	    Updated the new(), label() and request() method of the
	    _private::URI class to use $self->as_string.
	 2. chklinks: Updated the new() method of the _private::URI class
	    so that only one referring URI is specified.  Redirections should
	    be handled with the "redir" array reference attribute (maybe).
	 3. chklinks: Code clean-up.  Removed all the version 3 subroutines
	    fetch_noredir(), get_links(), proc_link_val(), is_excluded(),
	    get_ua(), get_target(), noreq_key() and rep_uri() from the main
	    package.  Removed all the version 3 global variables from the
	    main package.  Use the %CONF configuration variable in the
	    parse_args() subroutine instead of the several old global
	    variables.  Clean-up the parse_args() subroutine on the URI
	    initialization, which I shall review them and see if I should
	    return them in the future.  Added the DEFAULT_RECURSIVE,
	    DEFAULT_PARENT and DEFAULT_NOREMOTE constants.  Set the default
	    value in the parse_args() subroutine.  Wrote a new check_links()
	    subroutine that only initialize and print out the _private::URI
	    objects, for debugging purpose.
	 4. chklinks: Fixed the check_links() subroutine so that it returns
	    when URI initialization fails.
	 5. chklinks: Added the new_cwd() method to return the current
	    working directory as a file URI, and moved the original current
	    working directory URI initialization from the new() method to the
	    new_cwd() method.  Rewrote the current working directory URI
	    initialization so that it works with UNC paths, and that it
	    returns a _private::URI object instead of a URI object.  Revised
	    the new() method so that it deal with a _private::URI object
	    referer instead of a URI object referer.
	 6. chklinks: Fixed the scheme_init_ok() method of the
	    _private::URI::file class to allow UNC paths when the current
	    working directory is also on a UNC share.
	 7. chklinks: Added the as_string() method to the _private::URI::file
	    class so that it deal with UNC paths and return the paths in the
	    native operating system format.
	 8. chklinks: Fixed the new() method of the _private::URI class so
	    that it only accepts one referer from the argument, saves "refs"
	    as an array of referers rather than an array of arrays of
	    referers.  Series of referers should be obtained from the "redir"
	    attribute, but not from series of referers.
	 9. chklinks: Fixed the new() method of the _private::URI class so
	    that it works with start paths in the native operating system
	    format.
	10. chklinks: Moved the request status checking code from the
	    fetch_noredir() subroutine in version 3 to the check() method
	    of the _private::URI class.

* From now on, Change log on the version 3 branch, if any, will have a "(v3)"
  tag in the future.  Change log without "(v3)" tags means change log on the
  version 4 branch.

2007-12-06 (v4)
	 1. chklinks: Moved the $UA variable from the _private::URL class to
	    the main package, and moved its scope from "use vars" to "our",
	    so that it is accessible to the _private::URL class and all its
	    subclasses.
	 2. chklinks: Renamed the _private::URL* classes ad _private::URI*.
	 3. chklinks: Added the target() method to the _private::URI and
	    _private::URI::mailto classes to return the requesting target
	    of this URI.
	 4. chklinks: Added the label() method to the _private::URI class to
	    return the label in the result report.

2007-12-06	version 3.09
	MS-Windows fix.  This may be the last release of version 3.
	 1. chklinks: Fixed the "from" address of the user agent to use
	    getlogin() and then getpwuid(), in order to work on systems
	    that only have getlogin() but not getpwuid(), like MS-Windows.

2007-12-05 (v4)
	 Forked the version 4 branch.  The logic of the current chklinks is
	 too hard to read, understand and extend.  I'm planning to rewrite
	 everything, with object-oriented code that handles different scheme
	 gracefully.  This can help handling the non-standard URL schemes
	 nicely without obscure conditional branches and loops.  Then I can
	 add checks on mailto URLs, put better handling on file URIs, and
	 maybe extending to other URL schemes in the future.
	 1. chklinks: Added "package main;" declaration to the main
	    package.  Added the _private::URL class to handle URLs, and the
	    _private::URL::http, _private::URL::ftp, _private::URL::gopher,
	    _private::URL::file, _private::URL::mailto classes as subclasses
	    of _private::URL to handle URLs of different schemes, and the
	    _private::URL::https class as the subclass of
	    _private::URL::http to handle the HTTPS scheme.  Added the new(),
	    scheme_init_ok(), check(), request() methods to the
	    _private::URL class.  Added the request() method to the 
	    _private::URL::http class.  Added the scheme_init_ok() method to
	    the _private::URL::https, _private::URL::file and
	    _private::URL::mailto classes.
	 2. chklinks: Moved the $THIS_FILE, $VERSION, $VERBOSE, %URIS
	    and $LOCAL_TARGET variables from "use vars" to "our" so that they
	    are available in the scope of the whole script.  Added the %CONF,
	    $UA variables to the main package.
	 3. chklinks: Added the $UA variables to the _private::URL class.  We
	    in fact does not need many $UA user-agent objects.

_private::URL::https, 

2007-12-05	version 3.08
	Documentation fixes.
	 1. README.zh-*, chklinks.zh-*.html: Fixed the description
	    "是用 Perl 寫的單執行緒連結檢查程式" to "是單執行緒的 Perl 連結

	    %ALLOWED_SCHEMES instead of filtering out everything but HTTP.
	 4. check_links(): Fixed the comment from

	10. Added noreq_key() and %NOREQ_HOSTS to prevent bothering servers
	    that are not available and returning HTTP 503.
	11. Support file:// scheme gracefully.  Added rep_uri() to report
	    the file:// URI gracefully.  Currently tested on Linux and
	    MSWin32.  More tests required.
	12. Moved chklinks from bin directory to the source root.

2006-05-27
	 1. Add the prototype declaration.
